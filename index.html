                I am interested in developing games and webs. I recently reverse engineered 2D games. These games were Timber and Snake games. I have a good experience working with object oriented languages like JAVA and C++. Those games i mentioned were built using SFML framework and OO C++. I am familiar with working JavaScript,HTML and CSS. I have my plans set already to become a freelancer and make money and get an experience in doing so. After i am sure i am a developer with all the necessary skills i would apply for companies like Tencent and the like. My dream is to become a well respected Developer with great Knowledge and experience in my field of interest. I want to change both myself and my parents life.

                <p id="prime-paragraph">In primary school i started slow. I was a kid who had a problem with past tense of verbs. I was obsessed with solving the problem i faced. It was the start of greatness for me.For the first time, I became the top student in grade 5<sup>th</sup>. In primary school i had a big opportunity to represent my school in question and answer contest which were held at Addis Abeba where i won and locally hosted once. i was given a chance to participate in STEM program at Debre Birhan university for 2 consecuative years.I gave my undivided attention to my studies.I scored 93% average and 99% percent in Ministry Exam.</p>

            <p id="highSchool"> In high school, i experienced many things that i had never thought that i was capable of . It was where i  fell in love for the very first time and i can say that it was very dissapointing for me not because i was rejected. Of course I was not rejected but thinking about such things at that time made me do silly things and not to focus on my studies. This was where my down fall began. I had to transfer to a new school but i had a hard time getting used to it  .Since i was a teenager at that time i had alot of argument with my parents especially with my father. My teachers had great respect and admiration for me. But i couldn't live up to their expectation. I started to lose my confidence because nothing seems to be working out as i expected. I had seen people losing hope in me but i couldn't give up on myself. As if all these were not enough my neighbour was killed in the street. This event pushed me to my breaking point. Long story short I would say high school was  an unpleasant experience for me.But i managed to score straight A or 4 in Grade 10 Matric exam. In the Entrance exam i scored enough which enables me to join Bahirdar Universtiy and join Software Engineering Department.</p>

                <p id="university">Joining Bahirdar university felt right.I was curious to see how a university life was like. The time i spent as a fresh man at Znezelima campus was one of the great times in my life. we spent 9+ hours daily studying. Since i came from Debire birhan i had and still have difficulties adapting to the weather condition at Bahirdar.After i joined Software Engineering department, Itried many things. I had a lot of fun developing snake and timber games even though i haven't reached at dynamically binding them. Since my pc doesn't support game engines like unity and unreal i am currently working on Web Development. I have given it a lot of thought about what to do with the classes i am taking and decided only to give my undivided attention to improve my skills. To be honest if you ask me what i want to become 2 years back from now, I would have told you that i want to become a medical doctor. It could have been possible if there was no affirmative action. I am not complaing and all that. But if someone like me who haven't even thought about joining Engineering could become a software developer who is able to develope 2D games with all that crash course going on you can see that this guy could fit in this career and must have a great determination and dedication, So you can see that i am the definition of that dedicated individual. Hopefully you are looking for individuals like me.I have a cumulative GPA of 3.95.</p>
